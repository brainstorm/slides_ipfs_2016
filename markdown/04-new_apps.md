IPFS ecosystem
--------------

* Orbit-db: your IPFS-backed MongoDB?
  * https://github.com/brainstorm/cgt-orbitsearch
  * https://github.com/haadcode/orbit/blob/master/ROADMAP.md#orbit---roadmap
  * https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/224


Current idea
-------------

* Modify the **ga4gh-server** backend with IPNS links pointing to/from CGT.
* Use IPFS-cluster to efficiently "pin" IPFS files.
* IPFS pinning: https://github.com/ipfs/faq/issues/160


Future
------

* Early days, mostly prototyping and testing
* Reporting bugs back to ecosystem as we go
* Further new crucial development happening this December 2016 on IPFS land.
* All in all, PoC deployed, but not production quality, yet... worth keeping an eye on.
